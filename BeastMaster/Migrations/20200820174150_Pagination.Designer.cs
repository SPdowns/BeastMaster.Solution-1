But although their mortality ranks them lower than gods it seems veneration of jinn had played more importance in the everyday life of pre-Islamic Arabs than the gods themselves. According to common Arabian belief soothsayers pre-Islamic philosophers and poets were inspired by the jinn.2019 Their culture and society were analogous to that pre-Islamic Arabian culture with tribal leaders protected their allies and avenge murder for any member of their tribe or allies. Although the powers of jinn exceed those of humans it is conceivable a man could kill a jinni in single combat. Jinn were thought to shift into different shapes but were feared especially in their invisible form since when they could attack without being seen.21 Jinn were also feared because they had been thought to be responsible for various diseases and mental illnesses.2219 Julius Wellhausen observed that such spirits were thought to inhabit desolate dingy and dark places and that they were feared.23 One had to protect oneself from them but they were not the objects of a true cult.23 Some scholars argue that angels and demons were introduced by Muhammad to Arabia and did not exist among the jinn. On the other hand Amira El-Zein argues that angels were known to the pagan Arabs but the term jinn was used for all kinds of supernatural entities among various religions and cults thus Zoroastrian Christian and Jewish angels and demons were conflated with jinn.20 Al-Jahiz credits the pre-Islamic Arabs with believing that the society of jinn constitutes several tribes and groups and some natural events were attributed to them such as storms. They also thought jinn could protect marry kidnap possess and kill people.24",

The Book of Enoch quite clearly details how Satan and his fallen angels created various hybrids by admixture. The Sphinx is the most well known such hybrid. The hippogriff is supposed to be a mixture of several animals and the author notes that in order to support its weight the wings would be so heavy that flight would be impossible which proves—without question—that it does not exist.10 In some traditions the hippogriff is said to be the symbol of love as its parents the mare and griffin are natural enemies.10 In other traditions the hippogriff represents Christs dual nature as both human and divine.11",

Lerna was reputed to be an entrance to the Underworld1 and archaeology has established it as a sacred site older than Mycenaean Argos. In the canonical Hydra myth the monster is killed by Heracles Hercules as the second of his Twelve Labors.2 According to Hesiod the Hydra was the offspring of Typhon and Echidna.3 It had poisonous breath and blood so virulent that even its scent was deadly.4 The Hydra possessed many heads the exact number of which varies according to the source. Later versions of the Hydra story add a regeneration feature to the monster: for every head chopped off the Hydra would regrow two heads.5 Heracles required the assistance of his nephew Iolaus to cut off all of the monsters heads and burn the neck using a sword and fire.6",

The Thessalian tribes also claimed their horse breeds were descended from the centaurs.Robert Graves relying on the work of Georges Dumezil17 who argued for tracing the centaurs back to the Indian Gandharva speculated that the centaurs were a dimly remembered pre-Hellenic fraternal earth cult who had the horse as a totem.18 A similar theory was incorporated into Mary Renaults The Bull from the Sea.",
